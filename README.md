# Static and Dynamic Malware Analysis Using Online Investigation Tools.
## Objectives
The first section of the malware analysis lab demonstrates how static analysis is performed by submitting an indicator of compromise(IOC) to a collection of antimalware programs and analysing the returned result. This section leverages the Virus Total online investigation tool. 
The second section performs Dynamic analysis by dissecting the malware at the binary level. This is done by leveraging ANY.RUN online tool.
The lab's primary focus is to prove that a flagged potential IOC is True Positive.

##

VirusTotal uploaded the file hash publicly to be scanned and the result was returned. 
The first section of the scan result shows a Community Score scoring the file hash 47 out of 63. It indicates its propensity to be a malicious file.

The second section contains six tabs each with information related to the uploaded file hash:

***DETECTION:*** This tab explains the activities of the code executed by the file making it malicious
