# Static and Dynamic Malware Analysis Using Online Investigation Tools.
## Objectives
The first section of the malware analysis lab demonstrates how static analysis is performed by submitting an indicator of compromise(IOC) to a collection of antimalware programs and analysing the returned result. This section leverages the Virus Total online investigation tool. 
The second section performs Dynamic analysis by dissecting the malware at the binary level. This is done by leveraging ANY.RUN online tool.
The lab's primary focus is to prove that a flagged potential IOC is True Positive.
